======================================
Welcome to the cinnabar documentation!
======================================

``cinnabar`` (formerly ``arsenic``) is an open-source framework within the Open Free Energy (OpenFE) eco-system which enables consistent and
reliable plotting of results from free energy calculations. Use of the package ensures a fair comparison of computational
methods via robust and reproducible metrics implemented in the analysis functions following standardized
best practices [1]_. ``cinnabar`` is designed with generality in mind, and can be used to analyse results from any free energy calculation software package.

Additionally ``cinnabar`` provides methods to estimate absolute binding afinities from calculated relative measurments and powers the `OpenFE CLI <https://docs.openfree.energy/en/latest/tutorials/rbfe_cli_tutorial.html#gathering-the-results>`_.

If you are looking to perform free energy calculations, see `openfe <https://docs.openfree.energy/>`_.
