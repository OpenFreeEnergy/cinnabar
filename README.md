# cinnabar (formerly Arsenic)

Issue: we _must_ report statistics consistently and we would _like_ to plot these results consistently too

Solution: The ``cinnabar`` package ensures a fair comparison of computational methods via robust and reproducible metrics implemented in the analysis functions following [standardized best practices](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v4i1e1497).
``cinnabar`` is designed with generality in mind, and can be used to analyse results from any free energy calculation software package.


## Installation

This package can be installed using `mamba`:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge cinnabar
```

## Getting started

To get started with ``cinnabar``, please see the [documentation](https://cinnabar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
